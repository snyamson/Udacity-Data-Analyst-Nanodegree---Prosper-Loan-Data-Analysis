# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by Solomon Nyamson


## Dataset

 This project explores the Proper loan dataset, which is Americaâ€™s first marketplace lending platform, with over $9 billion in funded loans. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information.

The project goes further to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among multiple variables using summary statistics and data visualizations.


## Summary of Findings

 After Analyzing the data, the following were the key findings:

 The distribution of both Borrowers Rate and Borrowers APR are similar, Also, the correlation coefficient between BorrowerAPR and BorrowerRate is 0.993 which implies a highly strong positive correlation meaning that, as BorrowerRate is increasing, BorrowerAPR will also be increasing. According to Statistics and Finance, the Borrower APR which includes fees, is always greater than the interest rate and it is depicted in it distribution.

  Also, the Loan Original Amount has a weak positive correlation with the Stated Monthly Income which implies that though the loaned amount given to a person will be based on Not only his or her monthly stated income but also other factors.

  There was found a negative relationship between the the Borrower APR and the Original Loan Amount. This implies that the annual percentage rate (APR) for the borrower will be lower as the Loan Amount Increases.

 Loans can be distinguished based on several characteristics rather than the initial loan amount. The term of the loan typically increases proportionately to the loan amount, with larger loans being allowed for 60 months. For this loan, the annual percentage rate (APR) and interest rate for the borrower are inversely related to the loan amount. This implies that interest rates will be higher for smaller loans and vice versa.


## Key Insights for Presentation

I will start the presentation with primary focus on the distribution of the Borrowers APR and the Borrowers Rate. The two variables will be introduced, followed by their plots.

Afterwards, I will present the relationship between the Estimated Return, Borrowers Interest Rate and the Prosper Rating.

Finally, I will look at the relationship between the Stated Monthly Income and the Monthly Loan Payment variable.
